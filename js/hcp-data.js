He never speaks down to you, and loves to emphasize that you, the parent, know your child's diabetes best, and he's there to help you along the way. He also has a great team with two CDCESs and a nutritionist as well. Dr. Bryant also supported us in our desire to use DIY Loop, and as a result, my daughter's A1c has been <6% for over three years now.",
